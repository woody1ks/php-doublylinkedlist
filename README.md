# php-doublylinkedlist
Straightforward implementation of the classic doubly linked list for PHP

/**********************************/

-Implement an add() method for the list that adds a single element to the list. The
method must add elements such that the elements are in ascending order when the
method returns. Assume data will be given to the add method in random order.

-Implement a count() method for the list that returns the current number of list elements.

-Implement a first() method for the list that returns the data for the first list element.

-Implement a last() method for the list that returns the data for the last element in the list.

-Implement a current() method for the list that returns the data for the current list
element. Method must return result of previous first(), last(), next(), or previous() call.

-Method must throw an exception if the list is empty.

-Method must throw an exception if one of the traversal methods (first(), last(), next(), or
previous()) has not been called to set a current element.

-Method must throw an exception if one of the traversal methods (next(), or previous())
has gone beyond the list.

-Implement a valid() method for the list that returns true if the  current method will return
valid data, false otherwise.

-Implement a next() method for the list that returns the data for the next list element.

-Implement a previous() method for the list that returns the data for the previous list
element.

-Implement a reverse() method for the list that causes the first, last, next, and previous
methods to return data in reverse order.

-Would like list reversal to be implemented with constant time complexity O(4), however
linear complexity O(4n) is acceptable.
